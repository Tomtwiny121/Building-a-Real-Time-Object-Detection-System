# Building a Real-Time Object Detection System

## Overview

This repository contains a capstone project for AI/ML fellows. The objective is to develop a real-time object detection model that can identify multiple objects from a live camera feed. The project is implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab. These projects help demonstrate the practical application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in solving real-world problems.

## Project 1: Building a Real-Time Object Detection System

### Objective
Develop an object detection model capable of detecting multiple objects in real-time from a live camera feed.

---

### Project Steps

#### 1. Data Preparation
- Use a pre-trained dataset like COCO or Pascal VOC.
- Alternatively, create a small custom dataset and label images using tools such as LabelImg.

#### 2. Model Selection
Choose a pre-trained object detection model:
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)
- Faster R-CNN

#### 3. Model Training/Fine-Tuning
- Fine-tune the model on the custom dataset if required.
- Use transfer learning to adapt the pre-trained model to your specific dataset.

#### 4. Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics such as:
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** Measure precision at various recall levels.
- **IoU (Intersection over Union):** Assess the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.

#### 5. Deployment
Deploy the trained object detection model in a live-streaming app using:
- **OpenCV** for real-time video processing.
- **Flask** for building the backend server.

## Stretch Goals
- Add custom object classes for specific use cases.
- Implement multi-object tracking for dynamic scenarios.
- Optimize inference speed using TensorRT or similar tools.

---

## Key Features
